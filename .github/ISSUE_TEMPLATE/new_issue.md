When asking questions or reporting issues, it is very helpful if you can include:

- Aider version
- Model being used (`gpt-4-xxx`, etc)
- Other switches or config settings that are active

The easiest way to do this is just just copy & paste the announcement lines that aider prints when you launch it, like these:

```
Aider v0.21.2-dev
Model: gpt-4-0613 using diff edit format
Git repo: .git with 134 files
Repo-map: using 1024 tokens
Use /help to see in-chat commands, run with --help to see cmd line args
```
