# Aider REST API - AI Pair Programming as a Service

This fork of Aider focuses on providing a REST API interface to Aider's powerful AI pair programming capabilities. While maintaining all the original CLI features, it adds a robust API layer that allows you to integrate Aider's functionality into your own applications and services.

## REST API

Aider's REST API allows you to integrate AI pair programming capabilities into your applications. The API server can be started using:

```bash
python -m aider.server [aider_args]
```

For example, here's an advanced configuration using multiple models and features:
```bash
python -m aider.server --architect --model openrouter/anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet:beta --editor-model openrouter/anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet --weak-model claude-3-haiku-20240307 --cache-prompts --analytics
```

The server runs on `http://0.0.0.0:8000` by default and provides the following endpoints:

### POST /init
Initializes an Aider instance with the provided configuration.

Request body:
```json
{
    "pretty": false  // Optional, defaults to false
}
```

### POST /chat
Sends a message to chat with Aider.

Request body:
```json
{
    "content": "Your message here"
}
```

Response includes an array of responses with different types:
- tool_output: Results from tool operations
- error: Error messages
- warning: Warning messages
- print: General output messages
- system: System messages
- assistant: AI assistant responses

### POST /stop
Stops the Aider instance.

## CLI Usage
<!--[[[cog
# We can't "include" here.
# Because this page is rendered by GitHub as the repo README
cog.out(open("aider/website/_includes/get-started.md").read())
]]]-->

If you already have python 3.8-3.13 installed, you can get started quickly like this:

```bash
python -m pip install aider-install
aider-install

# Change directory into your code base
cd /to/your/project

# Work with Claude 3.5 Sonnet on your code
aider --model sonnet --anthropic-api-key your-key-goes-here

# Work with GPT-4o on your code
aider --model gpt-4o --openai-api-key your-key-goes-here
```
