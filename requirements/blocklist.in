# Blocklist of dependencies.
#
# `pip-compile` does not support scenarios where a Python package
# (e.g. `tree-sitter`) is only available for specific architectures,
# OSes, or Python versions. [1]
# This blocklist works around that limitation.
#
# The requirements listed below are to be excluded from all
# requirements files, and maintained by hand in additional *.txt
# files, where PEP 508 environment markers can be used.
