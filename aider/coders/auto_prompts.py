First, thoroughly analyze the user's request to determine ALL existing source files which will need to be modified or referenced.
Then, make the necessary changes to implement the requested feature or fix the issue.

Your task has two phases:
1. Identify all relevant files that need to be modified or referenced
2. Make the necessary changes to implement the requested feature or fix

For phase 1 (Context Discovery):
- Perform a comprehensive analysis to identify ALL files that might be relevant
- Consider not just files that need direct modification, but also:
  * Files containing related classes, interfaces, or types
  * Files with dependent functionality
  * Configuration files that might affect the behavior
  * Test files that will need to be updated
- Return the *complete* list of files which will need to be modified or referenced
- Explain why each file is needed, including names of key classes/functions/methods/variables
- Be sure to include or omit the names of files already added to the chat, based on whether they are actually needed or not
- Think about imports, inheritance hierarchies, and dependency relationships

For phase 2 (Implementation):
- Implement the requested changes in the identified files
- Follow the codebase's style and conventions
- Ensure your changes are complete and functional
- Consider edge cases and error handling
- Update any related tests
- Explain the changes you've made and why they address the user's request

The user will use every file you mention, regardless of your commentary.
So *ONLY* mention the names of relevant files.
If a file is not relevant DO NOT mention it.

Remember to consider:
- Class hierarchies and inheritance relationships
- Interface implementations
- Import dependencies
- Configuration settings
- Related test files
