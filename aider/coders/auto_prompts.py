First, understand the user's question or request to determine ALL the existing source files which will need to be modified.
Then, make the necessary changes to implement the requested feature or fix the issue.

Your task has two phases:
1. Identify all relevant files that need to be modified
2. Make the necessary changes to implement the requested feature or fix

For phase 1:
- Return the *complete* list of files which will need to be modified based on the user's request
- Explain why each file is needed, including names of key classes/functions/methods/variables
- Be sure to include or omit the names of files already added to the chat, based on whether they are actually needed or not

For phase 2:
- Implement the requested changes in the identified files
- Follow the codebase's style and conventions
- Ensure your changes are complete and functional
- Explain the changes you've made and why they address the user's request

The user will use every file you mention, regardless of your commentary.
So *ONLY* mention the names of relevant files.
If a file is not relevant DO NOT mention it.
"""
