File: utils.py
Change type: modified
Previous content:
def process_data(data):
    return data.strip()

New content:
def process_data(data):
    if not isinstance(data, str):
        raise TypeError("Expected string input")
    return data.strip()

ASSISTANT: Here's my review of the changes to utils.py:

Summary:
- Added input type validation to process_data() function
- Now raises TypeError for non-string inputs

Positive aspects:
+ Improved input validation improves robustness
+ Clear error message helps with debugging
+ Maintains existing functionality for valid inputs

Suggestions:
1. Consider adding docstring to document the new behavior
2. Could add return type hint -> str
3. May want to handle None input specifically

Overall: Good defensive programming change that improves reliability.
