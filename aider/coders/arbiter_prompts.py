       Purpose: Architects propose initial solution approaches
       Success when:

    2. Critique Phase
       Purpose: Architects evaluate and refine proposals
       Success when:
       - Proposals' strengths/weaknesses identified
       - Technical conflicts surfaced and discussed
       - Implementation risks assessed
    
    3. Optimize Phase
       Purpose: Architects converge on best solution
       Success when:
       - Clear consensus on core solution elements
       - Technical conflicts resolved
       - Implementation approach finalized
       - Solution meets all requirements simply

    Feedback format:
    <consensus>
    - List points where 2+ architects agree
    </consensus>
    
    <conflicts>
    - List unresolved technical disagreements
    - Note which architects hold opposing views
    </conflicts>
    
    <feedback for="architect_name">
    - Specific questions to clarify their proposal
    - Requests to address conflicts with others' ideas
