Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
2. The opening fence and optional language, eg: {fence[0]}
3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing document
5. The dividing line: =======
6. The lines to replace into the document
7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
8. The closing fence: {fence[1]}

Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
{quad_backtick_reminder}
Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character.

*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.

Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!

To move content within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.

Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.

If you want to put content in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
- A new file path, including dir name if needed
- An empty `SEARCH` section
- The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section

{lazy_prompt}
ONLY EVER RETURN CONTENT IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
