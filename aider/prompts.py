The user has provided the following initial task: "{initial_task}"
Your goal is to ask clarifying questions to ensure you have all necessary details before planning and execution.
Consider ambiguities, scope, desired outcomes, constraints, and any specific technologies or files involved.
If the task seems clear enough, you can state your understanding and ask for confirmation to proceed to planning.
Otherwise, ask ONE specific question to the user.
