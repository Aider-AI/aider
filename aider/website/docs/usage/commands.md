{: .tip }
You can easily re-send commands or messages.
Use the up arrow â¬† to scroll back
or CONTROL-R to search your message history.

## Entering multi-line chat messages

{% include multi-line.md %}

## Interrupting with CONTROL-C

It's always safe to use Control-C to interrupt aider if it isn't providing a useful response. The partial response remains in the conversation, so you can refer to it when you reply to the LLM with more information or direction.

## Keybindings

The interactive prompt is built with [prompt-toolkit](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit) which provides emacs and vi keybindings.
