# Ollama

Aider can connect to local Ollama models.

```
# Pull the model
ollama pull <model>

# Start your ollama server
ollama serve

# In another terminal window...
python -m pip install -U aider-chat

export OLLAMA_API_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:11434 # Mac/Linux
setx   OLLAMA_API_BASE http://127.0.0.1:11434 # Windows, restart shell after setx

aider --model ollama_chat/<model>
```

{: .note }
Using `ollama_chat/` is recommended over `ollama/`.


See the [model warnings](warnings.html)
section for information on warnings which will occur
when working with models that aider is not familiar with.

## API Key

If you are using an ollama that requires an API key you can set `OLLAMA_API_KEY`:

```
export OLLAMA_API_KEY=<api-key> # Mac/Linux
setx   OLLAMA_API_KEY <api-key> # Windows, restart shell after setx
```

## Setting the context window size

[Ollama uses a 2k context window by default](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#how-can-i-specify-the-context-window-size),
which is very small for working with aider.
It also **silently** discards context that exceeds the window. 
This is especially dangerous because many users don't even realize that most of their data
is being discarded by Ollama.
 
By default, aider sets Ollama's context window 
to be large enough for each request you send plus 8k tokens for the reply.
This ensures data isn't silently discarded by Ollama.

If you'd like you can configure a fixed sized context window instead
with an
[`.aider.model.settings.yml` file](https://aider.chat/docs/config/adv-model-settings.html#model-settings)
like this:

```
- name: ollama/qwen2.5-coder:32b-instruct-fp16
  extra_params:
    num_ctx: 65536
```
