# Anthropic

To work with Anthropic's models, you need to provide your
[Anthropic API key](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/getting-started-with-the-api)
either in the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable or
via the `--anthropic-api-key` command line switch.

Aider has some built in shortcuts for the most popular Anthropic models and
has been tested and benchmarked to work well with them:

```
python -m pip install -U aider-chat

export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<key> # Mac/Linux
setx   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY <key> # Windows, restart shell after setx

# Aider uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet by default (or use --sonnet)
aider

# Claude 3 Opus
aider --opus

# List models available from Anthropic
aider --list-models anthropic/
```

{: .tip }
Anthropic has very low rate limits. 
You can access all the Anthropic models via
[OpenRouter](openrouter.md)
or [Google Vertex AI](vertex.md)
with more generous rate limits.

You can use `aider --model <model-name>` to use any other Anthropic model.
For example, if you want to use a specific version of Opus
you could do `aider --model claude-3-opus-20240229`.

## Thinking tokens

Aider can work with Sonnet 3.7's new thinking tokens, but does not ask Sonnet to use
thinking tokens by default.

Enabling thinking currently requires manual configuration.
You need to add the following to your `.aider.model.settings.yml` 
[model settings file](http://127.0.0.1:4000/docs/config/adv-model-settings.html#model-settings).
Adjust the `budget_tokens` value to change the target number of thinking tokens.

```yaml

More streamlined support will be coming soon.
