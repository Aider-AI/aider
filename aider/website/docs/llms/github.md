# GitHub Copilot

Aider can connect to GitHub Copilot’s LLMs because Copilot exposes a standard **OpenAI-style**
endpoint at:

```
https://api.githubcopilot.com
```

First, install aider:

{% include install.md %}

---

## Configure your environment

```bash
# macOS/Linux
export OPENAI_API_BASE=https://api.githubcopilot.com
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<oauth_token>

# Windows (PowerShell)
setx OPENAI_API_BASE https://api.githubcopilot.com
setx OPENAI_API_KEY  <oauth_token>
# …restart the shell after setx commands
```

---

### Where do I get the token?
The easiest path is to sign in to Copilot from any JetBrains IDE (PyCharm, GoLand, etc).
After you authenticate a file appears:

```
~/.config/github-copilot/apps.json
```

Copy the `oauth_token` value – that string is your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

*Note:* tokens created by the Neovim **copilot.lua** plugin (old `hosts.json`) sometimes lack the
needed scopes. If you see “access to this endpoint is forbidden”, regenerate the token with a
JetBrains IDE or the VS Code Copilot extension.

## Discover available models

Copilot hosts many models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc).  
List the models your subscription allows with:

```bash
curl -s https://api.githubcopilot.com/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Copilot-Integration-Id: vscode-chat" | jq -r '.data[].id'
```

Each returned ID can be used with aider by **prefixing it with `openai/`**:

```bash
aider --model openai/gpt-4o
# or
aider --model openai/claude-3.7-sonnet-thought
```

---

## Quick start

```bash
# change into your project
cd /to/your/project

# talk to Copilot
aider --model openai/gpt-4o
```

---

## Optional config file (`~/.aider.conf.yml`)

```yaml
openai-api-base: https://api.githubcopilot.com
openai-api-key:  "<oauth_token>"
model:           openai/gpt-4o
weak-model:      openai/gpt-4o-mini
show-model-warnings: false
```

## FAQ

* Calls made through aider are billed through your Copilot subscription  
  (aider will still print *estimated* costs).
* The Copilot docs explicitly allow third-party “agents” that hit this API – aider is playing by
  the rules.
* Aider talks directly to the REST endpoint—no web-UI scraping or browser automation.
