# GROQ

Groq currently offers *free* API access to the models they host.
The Llama 3 70B model works
well with aider and is comparable to GPT-3.5 in code editing performance.
You'll need a [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com/keys).

To use **Llama3 70B**:

```
python -m pip install aider-chat

export GROQ_API_KEY=<key> # Mac/Linux
setx   GROQ_API_KEY <key> # Windows, restart shell after setx

aider --model groq/llama3-70b-8192

# List models available from Groq
aider --list-models groq/
```
