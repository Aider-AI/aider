# Privacy policy

[Aider AI LLC](/docs/faq.html#what-is-aider-ai-llc)
(“Aider,” “we,” “our,” and/or “us”) values the privacy of individuals who use our website, programming tools, and related services (collectively, our “Services”). This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) explains how we collect, use, and disclose information from users of our Services. By using our Services, you agree to the collection, use, disclosure, and procedures this Privacy Policy describes. 

### Information We Collect

We may collect a variety of information from or about you or your devices from various sources, as described below.

### A. Information You Provide to Us.

**Communications.** If you contact us directly, we may receive additional information about you, such as your name, email address, the contents of a message or attachments that you may send to us, and other information you choose to provide.

### B. Information We Collect When You Use Our Services. 

**Device Information.** We may receive information about the device and software you use to access our Services, including IP address, device type, device identifiers, web browser type and version, and operating system version.

**Usage Information.** We may automatically receive information about your interactions with our Services, like the pages or other content you view, referrer information (the website you visited before coming to our Services), and the dates and times of your visits.

**Analytics Information.** If you use our programming tools, we may receive information about your interactions with the tools, such as how often certain features or commands are used, information about exceptions and errors, and which large language models are used. This information is associated with a randomly generated identifier, not any directly identifiable user information such as your name or email address. Please see the “Your Choices” section below for information on how to disable the collection of this information.

**Information from Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.** We and our third-party partners may collect information about your activities on our Services using cookies, pixel tags, SDKs, or other tracking technologies. Our third-party partners, such as analytics and security partners, may also use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across different services. 


### How We Use the Information We Collect

We use the information we collect:
 
- To provide, maintain, improve, and enhance our Services;
- To understand and analyze how you use our Services and develop new products, services, features, and functionality;
- To communicate with you, provide you with updates and other information relating to our Services, provide information that you request, respond to comments and questions, and otherwise provide customer support;
- To generate anonymized or aggregate data containing only de-identified, non-personal information that we may use for any lawful purposes such as to publish reports;
- To find and prevent fraud and abuse, and respond to trust and safety issues that may arise; 
- For compliance purposes, including enforcing our legal rights, or as may be required by applicable laws and regulations or requested by any judicial process or governmental agency; and
- For other purposes for which we provide specific notice at the time the information is collected.

### How We Disclose the Information We Collect

**Affiliates.** We may disclose any information we receive to our current or future affiliates for any of the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.  

**Vendors and Service Providers.** We may disclose any information we receive to vendors and service providers retained in connection with the provision of our Services. 

**Analytics Partners.** We may use analytics services to collect and process certain analytics data to improve our Services, such as by improving the ability of our programming tools to work with LLMs, edit code, and complete user requests. 

**As Required By Law and Similar Disclosures.** We may access, preserve, and disclose your information if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to: (a) comply with law enforcement requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; (b) respond to your requests; or (c) protect your, our, or others’ rights, property, or safety. For the avoidance of doubt, the disclosure of your information may occur if you post any objectionable content on or through the Services.

**Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers.** We may transfer your information to service providers, advisors, potential transactional partners, or other third parties in connection with the consideration, negotiation, or completion of a corporate transaction in which we are acquired by or merged with another company or we sell, liquidate, or transfer all or a portion of our assets. The use of your information following any of these events will be governed by the provisions of this Privacy Policy in effect at the time the applicable information was collected.

**Consent.** We may also disclose your information with your permission.

### Your Choices

**Analytics Information.** You can turn off analytics collection when using our programming tools. Please visit this 
[documentation page](/docs/more/analytics.html)
for more information about the data collected and your options.

### Third Parties

Our Services may contain links to other websites, products, or services that we do not own or operate. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties. Please be aware that this Privacy Policy does not apply to your activities on these third-party services or any information you disclose to these third parties. We encourage you to read their privacy policies before providing any information to them.

### Security 

We make reasonable efforts to protect your information by using physical and electronic safeguards designed to improve the security of the information we maintain. However, because no electronic transmission or storage of information can be entirely secure, we can make no guarantees as to the security or privacy of your information.

### Children’s Privacy

We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use personal information from children under 18 years of age, and no part of our Service(s) is directed to children. If you learn that a child has provided us with personal information in violation of this Privacy Policy, then you may alert us at privacy@aider.chat.

### International Visitors

Our Services are hosted in the United States and intended for visitors located within the United States. If you choose to use the Services from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you are transferring your personal information outside of those regions to the U.S. for storage and processing. We may also transfer your data from the U.S. to other countries or regions in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Services. By providing any information, including personal information, on or to the Services, you consent to such transfer, storage, and processing. 


### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We will post any adjustments to the Privacy Policy on this page, and the revised version will be effective when it is posted. If we materially change the ways in which we use or disclose personal information previously collected from you through the Services, we will notify you through the Services, by email, or other communication.

### Contact Information

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about our processing activities, please email us at privacy@aider.chat.
