You can send long, multi-line messages in the chat in a few ways:
  - Paste a multi-line message directly into the chat.
  - Enter `{` alone on the first line to start a multiline message and `}` alone on the last line to end it.
  - Use Meta-ENTER to start a new line without sending the message (Esc+ENTER in some environments).
  - Use `/paste` to paste text from the clipboard into the chat.
