You can send long, multi-line messages in the chat in a few ways:
  - Paste a multi-line message directly into the chat.
  - Enter `{` alone on the first line to start a multiline message and `}` alone on the last line to end it.
  - Enter `{tag` (where "tag" is any sequence of letters/numbers) and end with `tag}`. This is useful when you need to include closing braces `}` in your message.
  - Use Meta-ENTER to start a new line without sending the message (Esc+ENTER in some environments).
  - Use `/paste` to paste text from the clipboard into the chat.
  - Use the `/editor` command to open your editor to create the next chat message.

Example with a tag:
```
{python
def hello():
    print("Hello}")  # Note: contains a brace
python}
```
