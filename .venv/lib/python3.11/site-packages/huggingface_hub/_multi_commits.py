    """Split a list of operations in a list of commits to perform.

    Implementation follows a sub-optimal (yet simple) algorithm:
    1. Delete operations are grouped together by commits of maximum `max_operations_per_commits` operations.
    2. All additions exceeding `max_upload_size_per_commit` are committed 1 by 1.
    3. All remaining additions are grouped together and split each time the `max_operations_per_commit` or the
       `max_upload_size_per_commit` limit is reached.

    We do not try to optimize the splitting to get the lowest number of commits as this is a NP-hard problem (see
    [bin packing problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem)). For our use case, it is not problematic
    to use a sub-optimal solution so we favored an easy-to-explain implementation.

    Args:
        operations (`List` of [`~hf_api.CommitOperation`]):
            The list of operations to split into commits.
        max_operations_per_commit (`int`):
            Maximum number of operations in a single commit. Defaults to 50.
        max_upload_size_per_commit (`int`):
            Maximum size to upload (in bytes) in a single commit. Defaults to 2GB. Files bigger than this limit are
            uploaded, 1 per commit.

    Returns:
        `Tuple[List[List[CommitOperationAdd]], List[List[CommitOperationDelete]]]`: a tuple. First item is a list of
        lists of [`CommitOperationAdd`] representing the addition commits to push. The second item is a list of lists
        of [`CommitOperationDelete`] representing the deletion commits.

    `plan_multi_commits` is experimental. Its API and behavior is subject to change in the future without prior notice.

    Example:
    ```python
    >>> from huggingface_hub import HfApi, plan_multi_commits
    >>> addition_commits, deletion_commits = plan_multi_commits(
    ...     operations=[
    ...          CommitOperationAdd(...),
