# Prompt Toolkit defaults

The interactive prompt is built with [prompt-toolkit](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit) which provides a lot of Emacs and Vi-style keyboard. Some emacs bindings you may find useful are

- `Ctrl-A` : Move cursor to the start of the line.
- `Ctrl-B` : Move cursor back one character.
- `Ctrl-D` : Delete the character under the cursor.
- `Ctrl-E` : Move cursor to the end of the line.
- `Ctrl-F` : Move cursor forward one character.
- `Ctrl-K` : Delete from the cursor to the end of the line.
- `Ctrl-L` : Clear the screen.
- `Ctrl-N` : Move down to the next history entry.
- `Ctrl-P` : Move up to the previous history entry.
- `Ctrl-R` : Reverse search in command history.

Note: aider currently exits vi normal mode after a single command, (maybe something to do with the esc keybinding?). Feel free to investigate and make a PR if you would like to see it fully supported.

Prompt toolkit also does not provide clear documentation on the bindings they support - maybe you can take aider and help them out with that and we can then link to the authoritative docs.
