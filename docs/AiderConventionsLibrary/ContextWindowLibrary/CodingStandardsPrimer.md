Design Principles and Preferences for Regenerative Architecture
==============================================================

This document outlines the design principles and preferences that we encounter or choose to use in our project. It serves as a guide for maintaining consistency and efficiency in our communication and architectural decisions.

Coding Practices
----------------
- **Modular Design**: Encourage the use of modular design principles to create reusable, maintainable, and testable components.
- **SOLID Principles**: Adhere to the SOLID principles to ensure that the codebase is flexible, scalable, and easy to maintain.
- **Design Patterns**: Utilize design patterns where appropriate to solve common architectural problems and promote code reusability.
- **Clean Code**: Write clean, readable, and maintainable code that follows best practices and coding standards.
- **Type Safety**: Embrace type safety to prevent runtime errors and improve code reliability.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling sufficient for a first operational prototype, and refine it as the project progresses.
- **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation for all code, including comments, docstrings, and high-level architectural overviews.


Use of SparsePrimingRepresentation (SPR):
------------------------------------------
- We adopt SPR as a standard practice for efficient communication within the project.
- SPR terms are concise, descriptive, and written in PascalCase, encapsulating complex concepts for ease of discussion.
- SPR terms should be used consistently across all project documentation and communication channels.

Instructions for Suggesting New SPR Terms:
------------------------------------------
- Always be on the lookout for opportunities to improve communication efficiency through new SPR terms.
- When a potential new SPR term is identified, document the term, its intended meaning, and examples of its use.
- Suggest the new SPR term for approval before adding it to the project lexicon.
- Upon approval, add the new SPR term to the `SparsePrimingRepresentation.yaml` file with its definition and examples.

This approach to regenerative architecture ensures that our project evolves efficiently, with a shared understanding that enhances collaboration and innovation among Developers / Language Models / AI or AE Agents.
