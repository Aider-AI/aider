## Observer in Python

**Observer** is a behavioral design pattern that allows some objects to
notify other objects about changes in their state.

The Observer pattern provides a way to subscribe and unsubscribe to and
from these events for any object that implements a subscriber interface.

**Complexity:**

**Popularity:**

**Usage examples:** The Observer pattern is pretty common in Python
code, especially in the GUI components. It provides a way to react to
events happening in other objects without coupling to their classes.

**Identification:** The pattern can be recognized by subscription
methods, that store objects in a list and by calls to the update method
issued to objects in that list.

## Conceptual Example

This example illustrates the structure of the **Observer** design
pattern. It focuses on answering these questions:

-   What classes does it consist of?
-   What roles do these classes play?
-   In what way the elements of the pattern are related?

#### **main.py:** Conceptual example

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from random import randrange
from typing import List

class Subject(ABC):
    """
    The Subject interface declares a set of methods for managing subscribers.
    """

    @abstractmethod
    def attach(self, observer: Observer) -> None:
        """
        Attach an observer to the subject.
        """
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def detach(self, observer: Observer) -> None:
        """
        Detach an observer from the subject.
        """
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def notify(self) -> None:
        """
        Notify all observers about an event.
        """
        pass

    The Subject owns some important state and notifies observers when the state
    changes.
    """

    _state: int = None

    For the sake of simplicity, the Subject's state, essential to all
    subscribers, is stored in this variable.

    List of subscribers. In real life, the list of subscribers can be stored
    more comprehensively (categorized by event type, etc.).

        Usually, the subscription logic is only a fraction of what a Subject can
        really do. Subjects commonly hold some important business logic, that

        happen (or after it).

        """
        pass

"""

attached to.
"""

class ConcreteObserverA(Observer):
    def update(self, subject: Subject) -> None:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # The client code.

    subject = ConcreteSubject()

    observer_a = ConcreteObserverA()
    subject.attach(observer_a)

    observer_b = ConcreteObserverB()
    subject.attach(observer_b)

    subject.some_business_logic()
    subject.some_business_logic()

    subject.detach(observer_a)
