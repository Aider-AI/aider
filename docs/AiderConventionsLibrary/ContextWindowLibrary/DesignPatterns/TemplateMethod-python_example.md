## Template Method in Python

Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to
defines a skeleton of an algorithm in a base class and let subclasses
override the steps without changing the overall algorithm's structure.

**Complexity:**

**Popularity:**

**Usage examples:** The Template Method pattern is quite common in
Python frameworks. Developers often use it to provide framework users
with a simple means of extending standard functionality using
inheritance.

**Identification:** Template Method can be recognized if you see a
method in base class that calls a bunch of other methods that are either
abstract or empty.

## Conceptual Example

This example illustrates the structure of the **Template Method** design
pattern. It focuses on answering these questions:

-   What classes does it consist of?
-   What roles do these classes play?
-   In what way the elements of the pattern are related?

#### main.py: Conceptual example

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class AbstractClass(ABC):
    """
    The Abstract Class defines a template method that contains a skeleton of
    some algorithm, composed of calls to (usually) abstract primitive
    operations.

    Concrete subclasses should implement these operations, but leave the
    template method itself intact.

    def template_method(self) -> None:
        """
        The template method defines the skeleton of an algorithm.

        self.base_operation3()
