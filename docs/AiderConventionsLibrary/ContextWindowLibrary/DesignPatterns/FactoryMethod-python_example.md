Factory Method in Python

Factory method is a creational design pattern which solves the problem of creating product objects without specifying their concrete classes.

The Factory Method defines a method, which should be used for creating objects instead of using a direct constructor call (`new` operator). Subclasses can override this method to change the class of objects that will be created.

**Identification:** Factory methods can be recognized by creation methods that construct objects from concrete classes. While concrete classes are used during the object creation, the return type of the factory methods is usually declared as either an abstract class or an interface.

## Conceptual Example

This example illustrates the structure of the **Factory Method** design pattern and focuses on answering these questions:

- What classes does it consist of?
- What roles do these classes play?
- In what way the elements of the pattern are related?

### main.py: Conceptual example

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Creator(ABC):
    """
    The Creator class declares the factory method that is supposed to return an
    object of a Product class. The Creator's subclasses usually provide the
    implementation of this method.
    """

    @abstractmethod
    def factory_method(self):
        """
        Note that the Creator may also provide some default implementation of
        the factory method.
        """
        pass

    def some_operation(self) -> str:
        """
        Also note that, despite its name, the Creator's primary responsibility
        is not creating products. Usually, it contains some core business logic
        that relies on Product objects, returned by the factory method.
        Subclasses can indirectly change that business logic by overriding the
        factory method and returning a different type of product from it.
        """

        # Call the factory method to create a Product object.
        product = self.factory_method()

        # Now, use the product.
        result = f"Creator: The same creator's code has just worked with {product.operation()}"

        return result

"""
Concrete Creators override the factory method in order to change the resulting
product's type.
"""

class ConcreteCreator1(Creator):
    """
    Note that the signature of the method still uses the abstract product type,
    even though the concrete product is actually returned from the method. This
    way the Creator can stay independent of concrete product classes.
    """

    def factory_method(self) -> Product:
        return ConcreteProduct1()

class ConcreteCreator2(Creator):
    def factory_method(self) -> Product:
        return ConcreteProduct2()

class Product(ABC):
    """
    The Product interface declares the operations that all concrete products
    must implement.
    """

    @abstractmethod
    def operation(self) -> str:
        pass

"""
Concrete Products provide various implementations of the Product interface.
"""

class ConcreteProduct1(Product):
    def operation(self) -> str:
        return "{Result of the ConcreteProduct1}"

class ConcreteProduct2(Product):
    def operation(self) -> str:
        return "{Result of the ConcreteProduct2}"

def client_code(creator: Creator) -> None:
    """
    The client code works with an instance of a concrete creator, albeit through
    its base interface. As long as the client keeps working with the creator via
    the base interface, you can pass it any creator's subclass.
    """

    print(f"Client: I'm not aware of the creator's class, but it still works.\n"
          f"{creator.some_operation()}", end="")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("App: Launched with the ConcreteCreator1.")
    client_code(ConcreteCreator1())
    print("\n")

    print("App: Launched with the ConcreteCreator2.")
    client_code(ConcreteCreator2())
```

### Output.txt: Execution result

```
App: Launched with the ConcreteCreator1.
Client: I'm not aware of the creator's class, but it still works.
Creator: The same creator's code has just worked with {Result of the ConcreteProduct1}

App: Launched with the ConcreteCreator2.
Client: I'm not aware of the creator's class, but it still works.
Creator: The same creator's code has just worked with {Result of the ConcreteProduct2}
```
