ReadingInstructionCodex:
  - This YAML file is a lexicon for the term "SparsePrimingRepresentation" (SPR).
  - It encapsulates the shared understanding of SPR within the context of our project.
  - The 'inferred_meaning' provides a concise description of what SPR represents.
  - The 'negative_definition' clarifies what SPR is not, preventing misinterpretation.
  - The 'preferred_acronym_usage' indicates the acronym that should be used for SPR.
  - The 'examples' section illustrates how SPR might be used in communication and documentation.
  - Use this file as a reference to ensure consistent usage and understanding of SPR across the team.

words:
  - term: "MultiIndexDataFrameBuilder"
    inferred_meaning: "A mechanism or process that transforms a flat DataFrame into a structured multi-index DataFrame, representing hierarchical data from XML."
    negative_definition: "MultiIndexDataFrameBuilder is not a simple data conversion tool, but a complex process that ensures the correct hierarchical representation of data."
    preferred_acronym_usage: "MIDFB"
    examples:
      - context: "The MIDFB will be used to convert the initial flat DataFrame into the multi-index DataFrame required for our analysis."
  - term: "XMLHierarchyExtractor"
    inferred_meaning: "A component that analyzes XML structure to identify and extract hierarchical relationships and unique identifiers for DataFrame construction."
    negative_definition: "XMLHierarchyExtractor does not modify the XML content but extracts structural information for further processing."
    preferred_acronym_usage: "XHE"
    examples:
      - context: "Our XHE module has successfully identified the parent-child relationships necessary for multi-index DataFrame creation."
  - term: "DataFrameIntegrator"
    inferred_meaning: "A process or tool that integrates parsed respondent data from various sources into a structured multi-index DataFrame."
    negative_definition: "DataFrameIntegrator is not limited to simple data merging but involves complex integration of disparate data sets."
    preferred_acronym_usage: "DFI"
    examples:
      - context: "The DFI will be responsible for combining the XML parsed data with the respondent answers to form a comprehensive dataset."
  - term: "MacroLexiconParser"
    inferred_meaning: "A parser that processes XML text elements into multiple lexicons, where the term 'Macro' refers to the keywords that are associated with underlying macros performing specific functions."
    negative_definition: "MacroLexiconParser does not refer to parsing macro-level language patterns, but rather to the identification and categorization of keywords that trigger specific macros within the system."
    preferred_acronym_usage: "MLP"
    examples:
      - context: "Our MLP has been instrumental in identifying keywords that correspond to macros, which are then used to automate specific functions within our system."
  - term: "QuestionnaireDataModel"
    inferred_meaning: "A comprehensive data model that includes all aspects of questionnaire data, such as PageData, PageDataItem, and their associated metadata, questions, and answers."
    negative_definition: "QuestionnaireDataModel is not just a database schema but a full representation of the questionnaire's logical structure."
    preferred_acronym_usage: "QDM"
    examples:
      - context: "The QDM has been updated to include new metadata fields as per the latest questionnaire design changes."
  - term: "AnswerDictionaryAggregator"
    inferred_meaning: "A process that compiles multiple child elements or attributes into a dictionary structure within a multi-index DataFrame."
    negative_definition: "AnswerDictionaryAggregator does not simply collect data but organizes it in a way that preserves the hierarchical context."
    preferred_acronym_usage: "ADA"
    examples:
      - context: "The ADA ensures that each PageDataItem's answers are grouped correctly in the DataFrame."
