Coding Standards Primer for operational prototypes
----------------
- **Modular Design**: Encourage the use of modular design principles to create reusable, maintainable, and testable components.
- **SOLID Principles**: Adhere to the SOLID principles to ensure that the codebase is flexible, scalable, and easy to maintain.
- **Design Patterns**: Utilize design patterns where appropriate to solve common architectural problems and promote code reusability.
- **Clean Code**: Write clean, readable, and maintainable code that follows best practices and coding standards.
- **Type Safety**: Embrace type safety to prevent runtime errors and improve code reliability.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling sufficient for a first operational prototype, and refine it as the project progresses.
- **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation for all code, including comments, docstrings, and high-level architectural overviews.
