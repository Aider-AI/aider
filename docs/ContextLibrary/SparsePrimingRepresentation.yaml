    preferred_acronym_usage: "MLP"
    examples:
      - context: "Our MLP has been instrumental in identifying keywords that correspond to macros, which are then used to automate specific functions within our system."
  - term: "QuestionnaireDataModel"
    inferred_meaning: "A comprehensive data model that includes all aspects of questionnaire data, such as PageData, PageDataItem, and their associated metadata, questions, and answers."

    examples:
      - context: "The QDM has been updated to include new metadata fields as per the latest questionnaire design changes."
  - term: "AnswerDictionaryAggregator"
    inferred_meaning: "A process that compiles multiple child elements or attributes into a dictionary structure within a multi-index DataFrame."
    negative_definition: "AnswerDictionaryAggregator does not simply collect data but organizes it in a way that preserves the hierarchical context."
    preferred_acronym_usage: "ADA"
    examples:
      - context: "The ADA ensures that each PageDataItem's answers are grouped correctly in the DataFrame."
  - term: "CloseTheLoopPrimeDirective"
    inferred_meaning: "A software development principle emphasizing the creation of end-to-end functional prototypes by starting with the expected final output and working backward to define all necessary components and interfaces. This approach prioritizes early user interaction and feedback."
    negative_definition: "CloseTheLoopPrimeDirective is not about perfecting each component before integration, but rather ensuring that all components connect and function together to meet the end goal as soon as possible."
    preferred_acronym_usage: "CTLPD"
    examples:
      - context: "By following the CTLPD, we were able to quickly set up a basic end-to-end flow and start user testing, which provided valuable insights for further development."
      - context: "The CTLPD approach helped us identify missing links in our data processing pipeline early in the project lifecycle."
  - term: "CommentDrivenDevelopment"
    inferred_meaning: "A development methodology where the design and logic of the code are first thoroughly outlined in the form of detailed comments before actual code implementation begins."
    negative_definition: "CommentDrivenDevelopment is not about writing comments for already existing code, but rather using comments to drive the design and development process."
    preferred_acronym_usage: "CDD"
