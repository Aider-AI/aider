Design Principles and Preferences for Regenerative Architecture
==============================================================

This document outlines the design principles and preferences that we encounter or choose to use in our project. It serves as a guide for maintaining consistency and efficiency in our communication and architectural decisions.


Use of SparsePrimingRepresentation (SPR):
------------------------------------------
- We adopt SPR as a standard practice for efficient communication within the project.
- SPR terms are concise, descriptive, and written in PascalCase, encapsulating complex concepts for ease of discussion.
- SPR terms should be used consistently across all project documentation and communication channels.

Instructions for Suggesting New SPR Terms:
------------------------------------------
- Always be on the lookout for opportunities to improve communication efficiency through new SPR terms.
- When a potential new SPR term is identified, document the term, its intended meaning, and examples of its use.
- Suggest the new SPR term for approval before adding it to the project lexicon.
- Upon approval, add the new SPR term to the `SparsePrimingRepresentation.yaml` file with its definition and examples.

This approach to regenerative architecture ensures that our project evolves efficiently, with a shared understanding that enhances collaboration and innovation.
